# HomeVision Take Home Project

## Getting Started

To run this program you need to have go installed on your machine.


```go run main.go```

> The program accepts ```--pageCount``` and ```--saveDir``` flags to set the page count and directory to save the downloaded images to. If unspecified, they default to ```10``` and ```./out``` respectively.
